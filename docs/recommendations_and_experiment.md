## Targeting (where & when)
- **Stations:** Top 10 casual hotspots led by **DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St** (see Fig.3 / Appendix).
- **Hours:** Weekends **11:00–16:00**; Weekdays **16:00–18:00**.
- **Eligibility:** Casual riders starting at targeted stations within the above windows.

## Treatment & Control
- **Unit of analysis:** *station-hour* (clean randomization; easy to operationalize).
- **Randomization:** Per **station-hour**, 50% **Treatment** (offer shown) / 50% **Control** (status quo).
- **Stratification:** Randomize **within weekend/weekday** (and optionally by station) to balance volume.
- **Treatment content:** “Weekend Day Pass → Annual upgrade credit” (CTA in app / on-dock).
- **Global holdout (optional):** 5–10% to check incremental lift bias.

## Success & Guardrails
- **Primary:** **Casual → Annual conversion within 30 days** of exposure.
- **Secondary:** Offer CTR, time-to-conversion, revenue per exposed rider.
- **Guardrails:** Member churn (no increase vs control), bike availability SLA (no degradation).

## Duration & Sample Size
- **Traffic assumptions:** ~**235** eligible rider sessions/day (≈ **120** weekday; ≈ **518** weekend).
- **Minimum detectable effect (MDE):** **+30%** relative lift vs baseline conversion.
- **Duration:** Run **~84 days (~12 weeks)** to reach power at current scope.
- **Powering note:** Need **n≈9,799 per arm** (α=0.05, power=0.80, MDE=+30%). To hit 4–6 weeks, expand hotspots/hours and recompute power.
