# Recommendations & Experiment Plan
## Targeting (where & when)
(Explanation: Focus where casual density is highest.)
• Stations: Top 10 casual hotspots led by **DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St** (see Fig.3 / Appendix).  
• Hours: Weekends **11:00–16:00**; Weekdays **16:00–18:00**.  
• Devices: Tailor creative by rideable-type mix (Fig.4) so prompts feel native to the trip context.

(Explanation: Concrete A/B plan with success + guardrail metrics.)

## Recommendations
1) Weekend Day Pass → Annual Offer at top 10 casual hotspots
2) Summer Weekly Pass with 14‑day upgrade credit
3) On-dock prompts during weekend afternoons (12:00–18:00)

## A/B Test Design
- Unit: station-hour (or station-day)
- Treatment: targeted offer (control: status quo)
- Primary metric: casual→annual conversion within 30 days
- Guardrails: member churn (no increase), ride availability
- Duration: compute via sample-size cell in notebook
- Analysis: difference in proportions (CIs)

## Rollout Plan
Phase 1: 10 hotspots × 4 weeks; Phase 2: 30 stations if lift ≥ X%.
