## 🎯 Targeting (Where & When)
- **Stations:** Top 10 casual hotspots led by **DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St** (see Fig. 3 / Appendix).  
- **Hours:** Weekends **11:00–16:00**; Weekdays **16:00–18:00**.  
- **Eligibility:** Casual riders starting at targeted stations within these windows.

## 🧩 Treatment & Control
- **Unit of Analysis:** *Station-hour* (clean randomization; easy to operationalize).  
- **Randomization:** 50 % Treatment (offer shown) / 50 % Control (status quo).  
- **Stratification:** Within weekend/weekday (optionally by station) to balance volume.  
- **Treatment Content:** “Weekend Day Pass → Annual upgrade credit” (CTA in app / on-dock).  
- **Global Holdout (optional):** 5–10 % to validate incremental lift.

## 📈 Success & Guardrails
- **Primary:** Casual → Annual conversion within 30 days of exposure.  
- **Secondary:** Offer CTR, time-to-conversion, revenue per exposed rider.  
- **Guardrails:** Member churn (no increase vs control), bike availability (no degradation).

## ⏱ Duration & Sample Size
- **Traffic Assumptions:** ≈ **235** eligible rider sessions/day (≈ 120 weekday; ≈ 518 weekend).  
- **Minimum Detectable Effect:** +30 % relative lift vs baseline conversion.  
- **Duration:** Run ≈ **84 days (~12 weeks)** to achieve power at current scope.  
- **Powering Note:** Requires **n ≈ 9 799 per arm** (α = 0.05, power = 0.80, MDE = +30 %).  
  - To reach a 4–6 week timeline, expand scope ( more hotspots/hours ) and recompute traffic + power.
