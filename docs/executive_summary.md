# Executive Summary — Cyclistic


**Business task:** Convert more casual riders to annual members.

**Key insights:**
1) Casual riders show distinct timing patterns (see hourly casual share); medians (min) — casual: 12.0, member: 8.7.
2) Strong seasonality with higher casual volume in peak months (see rides per month).
3) Top casual hotspot: DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St — concentration enables focused offer placement.

**Actions:**
• Deploy weekend/daytime prompts at top hotspots.
• Trial a weekly pass with time-bound upgrade to annual.
• Instrument on-dock offer messaging and in-app prompts.

Casual share peaks on weekends **11:00–16:00**; secondary peak on weekdays **16:00–18:00**. Prompts and offers will be concentrated in these windows.

**Metrics:** 30-day casual→annual conversion; offer CTR; guardrails on member churn and bike availability.

**Sizing sketch:** From ~253668 hotspot casual rides, projected **951** new annual members at current assumptions.
