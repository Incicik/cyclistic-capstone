# Executive Summary — Cyclistic


**Business task:** Convert more casual riders to annual members.

**Key insights:**
1) "Casual riders show distinct timing patterns - median ride length (min): casual: 12.0, member: 8.7."
2) "Strong seasonality: casual volume peaks in warmer months."
3) "Top casual hotspot: DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, allowing focused offer placement."

**Recommended Actions:** 

• Deploy weekend/daytime prompts at top hotspots.
• Trial a weekly pass with time-bound upgrade to annual membership.
